# About IPerity and Compass

IPerity builds cloud-telephony and Unified Communication solutions that replace a legacy PBX.

Our main software solution, Compass, can be offered as hosted and fully redundant, but can also be provided in a private or hybrid cloud model. The main difference of Compass compared to other PBX solutions is that our main focus is offering an API; and thereby enabling other companies to build their applications on it. We also take pride in the fact that we help and support our partner companies every step of the way by delivering useful templates, tutorials and pieces of advice, ensuring the best quality results.

In essence, Compass functions as a PBX foundation with its accompanying building blocks. The biggest benefit of this approach is meeting specific customer needs and requirements in various niche markets.
